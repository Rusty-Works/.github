hey there 👋

welcome to rusty works — a place where i collect and share everything i’m building with rust. rust is powerful but sometimes tricky to show off, so this org is my way of putting all my rust projects, experiments, and ideas in one place.

what’s this all about?

i’m learning rust and exploring what it can do. from backend systems to real-time tools, i want to share the journey in a way that’s open and easy to follow. this org is where i’ll keep all the code, docs, and demos so others can learn alongside me.

what can you find here?

- all my rust projects in one space  
- live demos and experiments  
- simple write-ups of what i’m learning  
- guides and tutorials i make along the way  
- real examples that turn rust concepts into something you can see and play with  

current focus

- building fast and reliable apis  
- working on data-heavy applications  
- experimenting with real-time systems  
- more fun stuff as i keep learning  

wanna join in?

if you’re curious about rust or want to learn with me, feel free to explore the projects, read the docs, or share your own ideas. i’m keeping everything simple, open, and beginner-friendly.  

let’s learn together and see what cool things we can make with rust 🦀
